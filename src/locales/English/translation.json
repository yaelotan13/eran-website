    "about-me-content": "Hi, my name is Eran Fos and I am a third year doctoral student of the planetary sciences at the Weizmann Institute. \nI earned my bachelor's degree in physics and atmospheric science at Tel Aviv University. \nDuring my undergraduate degree, I published an article on internal structures of planets outside the solar system. \nI earned my master's degree at the Weizmann Institute of Planetary Sciences as I explored the climate and water cycle in Mars.\nIn Ph.D., I build a climate model that accurately predicts the Mars water cycle under climate change that Mars has experienced\nin the last 10 million years and gives predictions for the climate of Mars.\nAmong other things, I am exploring other things like clouds on Earth and the chemistry of underground oceans in different moons in the solar system.\nIn my free time I love to do sports, especially surf.\nIn addition, I volunteer at a nonprofit called \"My Wave\" that uses a surfboard learning tool for at-risk youth education.\nIn my past, after my release from the military, I was a software developer at several startups and a product manager at Verint.\n"
